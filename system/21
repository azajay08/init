#List all real users on the VM

cat /etc/passwd | grep '/home' | awk -F: '{print $1}'

#From the list of users, ones that have 'home' in the path
#are real users.
#You can also list them by narrowing down the users UID's
#All the real users UID's are over 1000. There is one user
#called "nobody" that deamons use so you can just exclude that
#if you were to view it that way. That command would look like ..
#'cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$3 >=1000  && $1 != "nobody" {print $1}''
