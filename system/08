#What file contains the RSA keys of systems that are authorized to connect via SSH?

~/.ssh/authorized_keys

#I generated a key with 'ssh-keygen -t rsa',
#then in the '.ssh' directory, there were 2 new files. 'id_rsa' and 'id_rsa.pub.
#I then used the command 'ssh-copy-id username@remote_host' in my case ...
#'ssh-copy-id ajones@debian', I then went through the prompts and then the 
#authorized_keys file was created automatically.
