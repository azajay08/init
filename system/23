#Explain how connect yourself as new user. (With graphic session and ssh session)

With graphic session, you just select or enter the user you want to log in as
then enter the password for that user.
If you want to a new user, you can just go to settings and create and new user
from there.

For the ssh session, you use the same instrcutons form question 17.
Enter'ssh <login>@<ip>' into iTerm for example, providing that the
port has been configured this way. It will then ask for the users password and then 
the session is set up.
In this instance it would be 'ssh ajones@10.11.199.26'
You can then connect yourself as other users by typing 'ssh <login>@<ip>' or 
'ssh <login>@<remote host>' in my case.. 'ssh user2@debian'
The first time I logged in this way, it asked if you are sure you want to continue connecting,
if you type 'yes' it will then ask for password of that user and then you are in.
