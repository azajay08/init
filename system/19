#List all services which are started at boot time and name this kind of services

systemctl list-unit-files

#This will list everything, however the ones that say 'enabled' are the ones
#that have been booted from the start. The 'disabled' have not.
#You can show the list for only those that are 'enabled' with ..
#'systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled --all'

#These services are called 'daemons'. A daemon is a program that runs in the
#background
