#Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var in a humanly understandable way 
#followed by the path of it.

sudo du -hsc /var/*

#'du' estimates file space. We need rights to access folder, hence the sudo.
#'-h' human readable. '-s' displays total size of specified directory and not files, 
#'-c' gives a grand total, not necessary but nice to know
